Computer-aided formalization of mathematics has taken a leap forward in the
last decade with the formalization of very large and complex proofs such as the
four colour theorem and the Feit-Thompson theorem. In this report we present a
formal proof of the \toom algorithm using the Coq proof assistant together with
the \ssr extension. The \toom algorithm is used to multiply polynomials and can
also be used for integer multiplication.
