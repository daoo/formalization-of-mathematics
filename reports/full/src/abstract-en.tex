Computer-aided formalization of mathematics has reached new
heights the last decade with the formalization of large proofs
such as the proof of the Four Colour Theorem and the
Feit-Thompson Theorem. In this report we present a formal proof
of the \toom algorithm using the Coq proof assistant together
with the \ssr extension. The \toom algorithm is used to
multiply polynomials and can also be used for integer
multiplication.
