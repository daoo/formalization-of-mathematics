This is the collected works from the Formalization of Mathematics bachelor
thesis at Chalmers in 2013.

The result of the project is a formal proof of the Toom-Cook algorithm in Coq
with the SSReflect extension.

The implementation of the algorithm and the proof is available in this repo as
well as a Haskell implementation of Toom-Cook and the full report (in swedish).
